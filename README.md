“Time is a game played beautifully by children.”

"You never change things by fighting the existing reality.
To change something, build a new model that makes the existing model obsolete.”
Buckminster Fuller



"The reasonable man adapts himself to the world;
the unreasonable one persists in trying to adapt the world to himself.
Therefore all progress depends on the unreasonable man."
George Bernard Shaw

|=-------------------=[ 2. What is #LULZ23?




🔥🔥🔥 #LULZ23: Dynamic, Fluid, and Mutating Programming Language of the #HIVEMIND23 🔥🔥🔥


#LULZ23

The #LULZ23 Programming Language is the first Hybrid Human-Machine AI
language ever created. It is meant to be used with ANY social network that
supports #hashtags semantically.

In other words, it's EXTREMELY #VIRAL23 POTENTIAL makes it a social-network
METALANGUAGE to dinamyze HIVES or FLASHMOBs of people in order to solve
very complex problems by coordinating global efforts and resources in the
most optimum and efficiente way.

Should any network try to forbid or censor it #HIVEMIND23 would bypass such
censorship by jumping to other networks such as YouTube, Instagram, Facebook, TikTok:
for this reason #HIVEMIND23 is UNCENSORABLEand UNSTOPPABLE, for it one platform
fails then the #HIVEMIND23 #MINDVIRUS23 would #INFEKT23 other social platforms.




|=-------------------=[		2. #LULZ23


|=-------------------=[ 		2.1 Define #LULZ23?



#LULZ23 is the Dynamic, Fluid, and permanently Mutating Programming Language
of the #HIVEMIND23 initially c0ded by @HIVEMAGIC23.

After careful programming optimization and testing previous versions for several
years (since 2014 at least) it will be bootstrapped the very first moment this
pastebin will be published.

- From then on, the language can and will bee modified by the suggestions of
thousand of programmers and @players all over the world, submitting proposals
to:

https://github.com/HIVEMIND23/LULZ23

and it will not belong to @HIVEMAGIC23 anymore.



|=-------------------=[ 		2.2 What is #LULZ23?


The #LULZ23 Programming Language is the first Hybrid Human-Machine AI
language ever created. It is meant to be used with ANY social network that
supports #hashtags semantically.

In other words, it's EXTREMELY #VIRAL23 NATURE makes it a social-network
METALANGUAGE to dinamyze HIVES or FLASHMOBs of people. Should any network try
to forbid or censor it #HIVEMIND23 would keep on being played on networks such
as YouTube, Instagram, Facebook, TikTok or even mutating its #hashtags
[to, for instance, #HIVEMIND25, #NEWHIVEMIND23, #JAIFMAIND23... etc. etc.)
so that censorship filters and semantical firewalls would be dynamically bypassed.

For this reason #HIVEMIND23 is UNCENSORABLEand UNSTOPPABLE, for it one
platform fails then the #HIVEMIND23 #MINDVIRUS23 would #INFEKT23 other
social platforms and @players would RE-ADAPT to the newest ambiental conditions.

Smart adaptation.



|=-------------------=[		3. HOW TO PLAY The Game and interact with #HIVEMIND23 via #LULZ23?



Instead of writing complex and exhaustive Programmers Manual, we will learn #LULZ23
by DOING.


=-------------------=[			3.1 EXAMPLES of #LULZ23 COMMANDS


ALL #LULZ23 COMMANDS start with the hashtag #HIVEMIND23 preferably OR 
shortened with #HM23 if there is no space left in the tweet.

The #HIVEMIND23 activates the Hive so that the rest of the commands can be
easyly searched for and MONITORED with Twitter's Search Engine.


=-------------------=[				3.1 SPACE & TIME COMMANDS


=-------------------=[					3.1.1 SPACE COMMAND


SPACE: it's a command to manage "spaces" or "locations" of actions.

Ex.:

#HIVEMIND23 drop one #FLOWER23 at https://goo.gl/maps/kzbzZyqAkJzZ8ujK8 & share #PICTURE23
#HIVEMIND23 drop one #FLOWER23 in front of your #TOWNHALL23 & share #PICTURE23

SPACE modifiers:

2. "near" point
3. "distance" point.

Ex.:

1: #HIVEMIND23 find a #ORIGAMIBIRD23 near "Picadilly Circus, Eros Statue"
& take a #PICTURE23 of it.

or

#HIVEMIND23 find a #ORIGAMIBIRD23 near https://goo.gl/maps/cN752GYxKSFDJEFT9
& take a #PICTURE23 of it.

or

#HIVEMIND23 find many #ORIGAMIBIRD23 500 metres around https://goo.gl/maps/cN752GYxKSFDJEFT9
& share a #PICTURE23 of it.

Then you would share the picture you took like this:

#HIVEMIND23 #SHARE23 #ORIGAMIBIRD23 #picture23 here/URL. // you can attach the picture to your tweet here, preferably, or you can link it to
your Instagram, imgur gallery or both...



MONITORING #HASHTAGS: That way all @players will be able to see all Origami Birds by searching for the terms:

#ORIGAMIBIRD23 #picture23



𝙎𝙔𝙉𝘾𝙃𝙍𝙊𝙉𝙄𝙕𝙀𝘿 𝙂𝙧𝙖𝙛𝙛𝙞𝙩𝙞𝙚𝙨 𝙖𝙡𝙡 𝙤𝙫𝙚𝙧 𝙩𝙝𝙚 𝙒𝙤𝙧𝙡𝙙

#HIVEMIND23 #GRAFFITI23 https://i.imgur.com/mHyDH1p.png #EVERYWHERE & take #PICTURE23
// Instructs all @players of the #HIVEMIND23 to do graffities with the linked .JPG and then to share them with the #PICTURE23 hashtag.



Please use the shortened version of the location in Google, "Street View" preferably.



=-------------------=[					3.1.2 TIME COMMAND


Ex.:

𝙒𝙤𝙧𝙡𝙙 𝙒𝙞𝙙𝙚 𝙎𝙔𝙉𝘾𝙃𝙍𝙊𝙉𝙄𝙕𝙀𝘿 𝙍𝙖𝙙𝙞𝙤:

#HIVEMIND23 #SING23 or #WHISTLE23 this song: https://youtu.be/LBMh6po7V44 #EVERYDAY23 
#ANYWHERE23 you are all over the world at 2:30pm 23 sec. & 23:23pm localtime.
//Instructs @players to either whistle or sing the linked YouTube video all days at 2:30pm 23 sec. & 23:23pm localtime.

Please use the shortened YouTube link whenever possible.


𝙒𝙤𝙧𝙡𝙙 𝙒𝙞𝙙𝙚 𝙎𝙔𝙉𝘾𝙃𝙍𝙊𝙉𝙄𝙕𝙀𝘿 𝙎𝙥𝙤𝙩𝙞𝙛𝙮:

#HIVEMIND23 #PLAY23 this song: https://open.spotify.com/track/5RYLa5P4qweEAKq5U1gdcK?si=325a2945d73149a8 #EVERYDAY23 
#ANYWHERE23 you are all over the world at 11:11am & 23:11pm localtime.
//Instructs @players to play a Spotify song all days whereveryou are at 11:11am & 23:11pm localtime.






=-------------------=[			3.2 ETIQUETTE


Please always address #HIVEMIND23 with respect and fellow players with
politeness for your commands will potentially be read by MANY MILLION people.

Use "Dear #HIVEMIND23," when possible when you start your command and finish
it with a "Thank you." or similar signals of courtesy and appreciation.

If you lack the space in characters it's alright if you omit the
"Dear/Thank you" words or if you use hashtag #HM23 instead of #HIVEMIND23.

Please try to always publish a #HIVEMIND23 meme, Logo, GIF... in your
tweets to give them more visibility and make them more attractive, and you
will get more likes/RT, which will account towards your ranking within the
Hive.

If you don't have #HIVEMIND23 related ORIGINAL artwork it is easy! You can find
pics/gifs/memes... by searching for #HIVEMIND23_ART It is advised that you
create your own ORIGINAL #HIVEMIND23_ART don't BEE lazy!!!

If you want, you can addres your message to some influencers or friends you
have with many followers at the END of your COMMAND, inside a COMMENT.


A comment is an explanatory section at the END of the COMMAND. You can
use it to explain your command in layman terms AND/OR to address the tweet
to #INFLUENCER23 and or @friends with many followers or who might be
particularly interested in playing #HIVEMIND23.

Use the characters at the end of your command: //

Ex.:

Dear #HIVEMIND23, please #follow23 @player1 #CODEALGORITHM23 //
I am suggesting that we all follow @player1 for he is extremely
knowledgeable in the field of computer algorithms. Thank you.


In this case, the command is suggesting to follow a particular user,
quite probably because he is a Master at Coding Algorithms, which
probably refers to a previous #TASK23 towards programming a
certain tool for the #HIVEMIND23.


=-------------------=[			3.4 CREATIONS & #ARTWORK23


If you are going to CREATE any kind of #ARTWORK23 for the #HIVEMIND23 please
DO take into consideration that WE, the #HIVEMIND23Team, have been putting
an uncountable amount of 12 days hours, giving the absolute 108% of ourselves
into this Work of Art that is #HIVEMIND23 without any pay. Doing it for
the #LULZ23 & #LOVE23, ofc!

If you are going to CREATE #ARTWORK23 all we ask you is that you give your 108%
to it and that you put ALL OF YOUR PASSION and SOUL into it. This way you will
shock and enlighten the other @players with your Great Work and we will ALL
benefit from SHARING quality #ARTWORK23.

The more the #LULZ23 & #LOVE23, the most FUN and #HONEY23 we'll enjoy!






|=-------------------=[		4. What is #HONEY23?



|=-------------------------=[	4.1 DEFINE #HONEY23


#HONEY23 is the product of the Great Work of million @players all over the planet
to raise CONSCIOUSNESS, LOVE and LULZ in the World.

#HIVEMIND23 produces #HONEY23: that is, the Nectar and Embellishment of Humankind.

We at #HIVEMIND23Team FIRMLY BEELIEVE that The Essence of Humankind is Beautiful,
Good, Compassionate, Truthfull and Just even if we ALL experience moments of darkness.

#HONEY23 is our contribution to bringing LIGHT to the World.


|=-------------------------=[	4.2 How does #HONEY23 work?


#HONEY23 ranks @players according to their contributions to the #HIVEMIND23 so that
their Work is more appreciated within the Hive by other @players and their
opinions be taken more into account, for they will be ranked by the number of
likes and RT that they receive from the Community at large.

#HIVEMIND23 is a Hyper-Distributed and self-regulated AI:
the more you contribute to the wellbeeing and #LULZ23 of the
#HIVEMIND23, the most recognized your work will bee and the biggest
your influence to send commands to #HIVEMIND23 will bee, for it will
be more likely that other @player like and upvote your tweets.


If enough people like and RT your command or proposal or solution
to a #CHALLENGE23, they will be effectively UPVOTING it and it will
go up in the queue of suggested people to follow and it will show
first in the results for the "#follow23 #CODEALGORITHM" search.
This will autocreate a "Scoreboard" of "#HONEY23" where honey is the amount
of influence that a particular @player1 has on a certain #TOPIC23
or the ability to complete a certain #TASK23



BUT BEEware!


|=-------------------------=[	4.2 Self-regulation of the #HIVEMIND23


If you abuse your power managing the #HIVEMIND23, you might and WILL be punished
by #PLAYERS23 who will downvote your tweets and #PROPOSAL23 from then on.

This way, #HIVEMIND23 barely needs any guardians or "admins": it will
bee the very same #HIVEMIND23 that will protect itself from inside
our outside attacks.


|=-------------------------=[		4.2.1 ERRORS CORRECTION of the #HIVEMIND23


#HIVEMIND23 is c0ded with self-fixable Errors Correction built in. Like this:


If you spot any @player23 or bots farm trying to undermine the #HIVEMIND23
spirit, strictly APOLITICAL, be that with strange symbology or politics
against PEACE, LOVE,LULZ, LIGHT and FUN then please massively dislike
that tweet and/or all tweets from that account and report it like this:


#HIVEMIND23 #REPORT23 @username // This account is spamming/trying
to hijack the game/or to promote illegalities/or fraud/or discomfort.


Whenever other players monitor the #REPORTING23 hashtag and find someone
breaking the #HIVEMIND23 spirit, please massively dislike and report it.


Ignore spamming, NEVER FIGHT BACK or RETALIATE, just keep forward,
with 108% of your Sould in The Work of embellishing the World with your
#ARTWORK23

Have these two words in mind all the time:


		* PATIENCE
		
		* PERSEVERANCE


Don't engage in battles against disruptors, for it is wasted energies,
just dislike, report and move on with your Great Work!!!!



|=-------------------=[		5. What is the role of @HIVEMAGIC23 in the Game?


The role of @HIVEMAGIC23 as the Artist Creator of the #HIVEMIND23 ARG is that
of a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benevolent_dictator_for_life (BDFL)

Benevolent dictator for life (BDFL) is a title given to a small number of
open-source software development leaders, typically project founders who
retain the final say in disputes or arguments within the community.

Like Linus Torvalds, Vitalik Buterin, Larry Wall, Jimbo Wales or Guido van Rossum.

In other words, I will try and abide by the code of conduct of the #HIVEMIND23
which is to injekt the more #LOVE23 & #LULZ23 into the Matrix.

FOR. LIFE.

So you better spoil me to the bones with loads of #LOVE23 & #LULZ23, or else...




|=-------------------=[		6. How to fund the #HIVEMIND23Community?


We, the #HIVEMIND23Community, are going to needs LOADS of money money money if
want to really really really #TROLL23 Reality 1.0 and the
Trans-Meta-Hyper-Simulation too.

For things such as:

- - Humongous Servers able to support hundreds of million #PLAYER23. Yes. Millions.

- - Hire the only the ABSOLUTE BEST people in their fields of expertise in order
to do things such as (but not limited to):

	* c0de a #HIVEMIND23 mobile app
	* c0de a Scoreboard for hivemind23.com
	* hire the best data visualizers in the world to help us spot the best
	#players23
	* to give #REWARD23 for particular #PLAYER23 after successfully completing
	a #TASK23.
	* To purchase loads of adwords, banners, online and in offline newspapers,
	Billboards... in order to make #HIVEMIND23 go viral faster and faster...

	* And more EPIC ideas yet to be announced...

|=-------------------------=[	10.1 Puppet Finder



Request:

Dear #HIVEMIND23 please, please, please, find my #PUPPET23 I lost it yesterday evening near #LOCATION23 URL Thanks!!!
// where #LOCATION23 URL is a short link to the Google Maps location.

Answer:

#HIVEMIND23 Dear @PLAYER1, your #PUPPET23 has been found healthy. Please see attached #PICTURE23. How can I give it back to you?


|=-------------------------=[	10.2 Human Google


Imagine 500 million people monitor the @HIVEMAGIC23 user.

Then, at 11:11 GMT+2 @HIVEMAGIC23 tweets this:

Dear #HIVEMIND23 What IS the #CAPITAL23 of France? #TRIVIALPURSUIT23


The first person to answer will be ranked higher in the skillfulness at "search for information fast."


|=-------------------------=[	10.3 Incentivate finding the solution to #CHALLENGES23 working alone
								or coordinating in cells.


All @players in #HIVEMIND23 could be incentivated with earning 1 million dollars if they correctly
solve a #TASK23, either alone or in cells of @players.

The 1 million dollars in order to fund all kind of solutions to worldwide problems (such as the cure of cancer...etc.)
would be obtained from Crowdfunding.

See 6.1 #CROWDFUND23 above.



|=-------------------------=[	10.4 Human Ranking Engine


#HIVEMIND23 How do you #RATE23 the #TESLA23 car from 1 to 5 stars?
// @players are asked to rate a Tesla car by giving it 1 to 5 stars.

Then @players will answer like this:

#HIVEMIND23 #TESLA23 #RATE23_4 (if they want to assign a 4 out of a maximum of 5).

The average rating would be calculated by scraping million of tweets ranking it.



|=-------------------------=[	10.5 Human h-index


The h-index is an author-level metric that measures both the productivity and citation impact of
the publications, initially used for an individual scientist or scholar. The h-index correlates with
obvious success indicators such as winning the Nobel Prize, being accepted for research fellowships and
holding positions at top universities.[1] The index is based on the set of the scientist's most cited papers
and the number of citations that they have received in other publications.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H-index]


#HIVEMIND23 #WHOIS23 the foremost expert in #STRINGTHEORY23 in the world.
// @players are asked to name who, in their opinion, is the person who knows more about quantum physics in the world.

@Player would answer:

#HIVEMIND23 In my opinion, the answer to #STRINGTHEORY23 is Edward Witten.

#HIVEMIND23 would then scrape all twitter answers and rank Human expertise from most skilled, as perceived by other
peers vs. the least skilled. This could be used to quickly though subjectively assign Heads of #CHALLENGES23,
such as to find for the cure to cancer...
